## Overview

Course project for EECS 489 (Computer Networks) implementing key networking components and experiments.

## Key Contributions

- Simulated network topologies in Mininet and wrote C++ socket programs to measure RTT and throughput, reproducing bufferbloat and analyzing its impact on latency-sensitive flows.
- Built a video proxy with load balancing and adaptive DASH streaming to improve quality of experience under varying bandwidth.
- Implemented a POX-based SDN controller, a TCP-like reliable transport over UDP, and an L3 router supporting ARP and ICMP.
