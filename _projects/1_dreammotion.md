## Overview

Course project for EECS 442 (Computer Vision) exploring text-to-video generation that disentangles subject identity and motion, using spatial and temporal LoRAs fused across diffusion timesteps.

## Key Contributions

- Developed a text-to-video generation method on top of AnimateDiff that separates subject identity and motion.
- Used a spatial LoRA for identity preservation and a temporal LoRA for motion control, dynamically fused across diffusion timesteps.

**Timeline:** Oct 2025 - Present

**Course:** EECS 442 (Computer Vision)
