## Overview

Course project for EECS 442 (Computer Vision) exploring text-to-video generation that disentangles subject identity and motion, using spatial and temporal LoRAs fused across diffusion timesteps.

## Key Contributions

- Developing a text-to-video generation method on top of AnimateDiff that disentangles subject identity and motion.
- Using a spatial LoRA for identity preservation and a temporal LoRA for motion control, dynamically fused across diffusion timesteps.
