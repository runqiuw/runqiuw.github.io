## Overview

Course project for EECS 553 (Machine Learning) on diffusion-based emoji generation and evaluation.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented a pipeline that synthesizes a combinatorial emoji dataset, trains an EDM-based diffusion model, and evaluates generation quality and novelty with multiple metrics.
- Ran ablation experiments over model size and training epochs, analyzing how FID/KID and MeanMSE evolve during training to characterize memorization versus novelty.

**Timeline:** Mar 2025 - Apr 2025
