## Overview

Course project for EECS 498 (AI-Enabled Mixed Reality) building an AR system that turns voice descriptions into AI-generated line drawings projected onto paper.

## Key Contributions

- Designed and implemented an AR system that converts voice descriptions into AI-generated line drawings projected onto physical paper for tracing.
- Implemented a GPT-4o + DALL·E 3 image pipeline and a Meta Quest 3 AR module (Unity + OpenCV/ArUco + solvePnP) for marker-based projection alignment.
