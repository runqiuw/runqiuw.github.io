Hi! I’m **Runqiu Wang**, a senior undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Science** at the [**University of Michigan**](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and **Mechanical Engineering** at [**Shanghai Jiao Tong University**](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

I enjoy building systems where sensing, hardware, and machine learning actually meet the messiness of the physical world. I’m currently working in the **AMI Lab** on sensing systems and applied machine learning, advised by [**Prof. Ke Sun**](https://samsonsjarkal.github.io/KeSun/). 

Broadly, my interests lie in **applied machine learning, ubiquitous sensing, mobile systems, and computer vision–driven environmental perception**, and I am preparing applications for **PhD programs in CS/ECE (Fall 2026)**.

My first name "Runqiu" is pronounced like "Roon-chyo".
