Hi! I’m **Runqiu Wang**, a senior undergraduate student pursuing a dual degree in **Computer Science** at the University of Michigan (B.S.E., 2024–2026) and **Mechanical Engineering** at **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** (B.S., 2022–2026). 

Currently, I am an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the **AMI Lab** at the University of Michigan, advised by **Prof. Ke Sun**. I am working on **Moiré-based Schlieren sensing** in real-world environments, where we embed Moiré stimuli into wallpaper and use low-cost cameras to visualize otherwise invisible heat plumes and gas-leak-like refractive index changes. I co-designed and implemented the **MoiréLens** framework, including **AutoMoiré**, an automatic calibration module that aligns the camera to the wallpaper and tunes the stimulus frequency to maintain stable Moiré patterns under changing poses. On top of this sensing pipeline, I built downstream machine learning components that collect hours of data and train PyTorch models for **dry vs. moist-heat classification** and **oil-temperature regression**.
