Hi!👋 I’m **Runqiu Wang**, a senior undergraduate student pursuing a [dual degree](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/academics/ipo/study-abroad/degree-programs/) in **Computer Science** at the [**University of Michigan**](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/) and **Mechanical Engineering** at [**Shanghai Jiao Tong University**](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/). 

I enjoy building systems where sensing, hardware, and machine learning actually meet the messiness of the physical world. I’m currently working in the **AMI Lab** on sensing systems and applied machine learning, advised by [**Prof. Ke Sun**](https://samsonsjarkal.github.io/KeSun/). 

I am interested in applied machine learning and computer vision for ubiquitous and ambient sensing, as well as XR systems that tightly couple the physical and digital worlds. I am currently applying to CS/ECE PhD programs starting Fall 2026.

My first name "Runqiu" is pronounced like "Roon-chio".
